Electric Vehicles (EVs) run on electric power instead of petrol or diesel. They use rechargeable batteries to store energy and an electric motor to drive the vehicle. EVs are eco-friendly, producing no air pollution and operating quietly and efficiently.  They help reduce fuel costs and dependence on fossil fuels. 

⚡ Charging Information about Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are charged by connecting them to an external power source that supplies electricity to the vehicle’s battery pack. Charging can be done at home or at public charging stations.
Slow Charging (AC): Takes 8–12 hours, suitable for home use.

Fast Charging (AC): Takes 3–6 hours, used in public stations.

Rapid Charging (DC): Takes 30 minutes to 1 hour, used for quick charging.

⚙️ Problem Statement

Although Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fuel vehicles, the lack of fast and widely available charging infrastructure remains a major challenge. Long charging times, limited charging stations, and inconsistent charging standards cause inconvenience for EV users, reducing the adoption rate of electric mobility. Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient, accessible, and affordable EV charging solutions to support the growing demand for electric transportation.
